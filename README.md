# Path On Paper
> [!WARNING]
> The game is in the very early stages of development and will not hesitate to explode if you look at it the wrong way. Don't go too hard on it, I made the first build in a single evening.

## Introduction
Path On Paper is a simple maze game that you play with your cursor. Move your cursor to the starting area with, traverse tight paths without touching the borders, and reach the end area to win.
## Levels
Levels are simply PNG images where the borders must be pitch black (#000000), the starting area blue (#0000FF), and the finish area green (#00FF00). Any PNG that respects these colors can be imported in the game to be played. So you can easily make your own using any digital art program! Also, any colour other than the three mentioned will be ignored, so you can get as creative as you want! _(anything that isn't rule 34 worthy, please)_

> Note: levels must be named in the following format `(unsigned 64-bit integer).png` ; the integer will be the ID of the level. If the level is named any other way, it will be ignored.

## TODO
### Soon
- [ ] main menu
- [ ] short trail following the player
  - [ ] maybe a permanent trail that you can't touch, to encourage people to make actual mazes
### Later
- [ ] user friendly drag&drop import system for levels
- [ ] In-game level editor
- [ ] soundtrack

## Why does it exist?
This is game is the child of two things:
- my childhood passion for solving mazes, which my mom used to make for me. I just could not get enough back of solving them quickly, as I shatter my mom's pride after she thought she had made the one I would give up on.
- one flash game whose name I don't remember, where you need to traverse tight spaces with your mouse cursor without touching the walls. I used to like this a lot when I was little. This is basically that but you can make your own levels easily.

The game is unpolished and it looks janky on purpose, because it was born in the spirit of youthful playfulness. I could not care less about how it looks, I care that you can create as well as take on this challenging experience.
## Goals
My main goal with the game is to grow a community of people who make, play and share levels with each other. It would be cool to see that.
